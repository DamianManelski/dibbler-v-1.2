  Dibbler changelog
 -------------------
1.0.0 [not-released-yet]
  - Added missing includes for NetBSD (and probably other BSDs). Thanks to
    Justin Cormack for providing a patch.
  - Fix for client crash if PD was requested, the server returned IA_PD,
    but without any IAPREFIX options inside. Added better checks. Thanks to
    Maciej Fijalkowski for providing a patch.
  - Cli: Received options are now applied in stateless mode (bug #246)
  - Rel: remote-id option is now being inserted correctly (RFC4649)
  - Rel: Relay agent is now able to insert relay-id option (RFC5460)
  - Rel: Relay agent is now able to insert client link-layer address option
    (RFC6939)
  - Srv: drop-unicast added. Server is now able to respond with status code
    set to UseMulticast if a client sent his packets to unicast. According
    to author's knowledge this was the last missing functionality of RFC3315.

1.0.0RC2 [2014-07-12]
  - Cli: segfault when invalid or incomplete auth parameters are specified
    Thanks to George Joseph for a patch (bug #289)
  - Srv: fixed leases are not added to AddrMgr. Thanks to George Joseph for
    a patch (bug #291)
  - Log message fixed. Thanks to George Joseph for a patch (bug #292)
  - Client options are now passed to notify scripts (bug #293)
  - Fedora RPM script contributted by Patrick Pichon, thanks!
  - Srv: Experimental performance-mode added
  - Compliation fix for Mac OS X 10.9/Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500)
  - The code compiles again with --disable-auth
  - Cli: does not send or expect AUTH option by default.
  - Win: Service dependency fixed for Vista and above
  - Notify script called only when non-empty script name specified.
    (thanks to Hernan Martinez for contributed patches)
  - Support for ppc64le architecture added (thanks to Snehal for sending patches)
    Dibbler now uses alpha version of libtool 2.4.2.418, which features
    fixes for ppc64le.
  - Cli/Srv: no longer crashes when reconfigure-key is empty (thanks to Hernan
    Martinez for fixing this!)
  - Doc update: vendor-spec options examples are now updated
    (thanks to Michael Rapoport for spotting this)
  - Win: detection whether client is run with administrative privileges
  - gtest tests linking problem on Ubuntu 13.10 fixed. Sort of. The tests are
    not linked statically by default. There is a --enable-gtest-static flag
    that controls that behaviour.
  - Minor Developer's Guide update.
  - Srv: reconfigure-enabled 0,1 directive added to the server. It controls
    whether server sends RECONFIGURE messages at start-up.
  - Srv: received prefix is now being truncated to appropriate length, so
    client sending prefix hints with host part set should no longer confuse
    the server (bug #295)
  - Win: Better shutdown when shutting down from Microsoft Mgmt Console (bug #162)
    (Thanks to Hernan Martinez for the fix!)
  - Added support for IPv6 address in vendor-specific information option, and
    fixed bugs in other vendor-specific options formats (based on a patch
    provided by Herman Martinez, thanks!)
  - Srv: Unicast address of IA_PD stored in the database is no longer lost after
    server restarts. That should make the reconfigure mechanism usable again.
  - Linux: daemon shutdown improvement. There was a possibility that the daemon
    will stall while shutting down. Thanks to Petr Pisar for providing a patch!
    (bug #251)
  - Cli: Dibbler now configures received addresses with /128 prefix, as mandated
    by the RFCs. In versions 0.5.0 to 1.0.0RC1 it used to be /64, which was an
    arbitrarily chosen value that happened to work in most, but not all cases.
    Please see discussion in https://klub.com.pl/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=222
    for details (bug #222)
  - Srv: Fix in remote-id option support. Thanks to Richard Ouseph for providing
    a patch. (bug #299)

    sent as one option with multiple sub-options, as clarified in RFC3315bis
    (bug #304)

    the patch!

  - Cli: It is possible to disable prefix split by passing "none" to
    downlink-prefix-ifaces (bug #306, github #10)
  - Cli: Ability to define prefix parameter to be sent as hints. Thanks to
    Maciek Fijalkowski for the patch!
  - Cli: Updated syntax for sending address hints. See section 6.8.3 in the
    User's Guide for details.
  - Cli: Sanity checks added: client now refuses to mix stateless with ia,ta,pd
    options. Thanks to Arifumi Matsumoto for reporting this issue!
  - Cli: empty inf-request messages should no longer be sent. Thanks to
    Arifumi Matsumoto for reporting this issue!
  - Cli: information refresh time option can only be used in stateless mode.

  - Srv: Support for remote-id fixed. Thanks to Richard Ouseph for the patch
