  Dibbler 1.0.0 Release Candidate 2 [2014-07-12]
 ------------------------------------------------

 This is a second Release Candidate for 1.0.0 release of the Dibbler software.

 Due to other obligations, 1.0.0RC1 was available for a very long time
 and I never had a chance to release 1.0.0 final. In the mean time, quite
 a few of fixes and small features were added (Changelog mentions 35 items,
 but I'm sure some of them were not listed). So formally this is a second
 RC, but it contains unexpectedly large changes for an RC. Keep that in
 mind. This time I expect the delay between RC and final to be much shorter
 (couple weeks).

 Couple changes worth mentioning:
 - dibbler client now configures received prefix with /128, not /64. This
   will likely raise some eyebrows, but that how DHCPv6 is supposed to work.
   Please see https://klub.com.pl/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=222 for extra
   details.
 - There are reports that Reconfigure messages are sent to the wrong address
   if the client connected via relays. See bug #303.
 - There are reports that Dibbler has problems on Ubuntu 14.04. That was
   traced to a Linux kernel issue and is fixed in 3.15.2. See bug #302.
 - Windows port improved, now using Visual Studio 2013 Express.
 - Issue tracker on github has been disabled. It was awkward to use both
   bugzilla and github.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.
