Abstract


   This document describes a new DHCPv6 option for passing a list of
   Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) server addresses to a client. 


1. Introduction


   This document describes a new option called SNTP [3] servers Option
   for passing information about SNTP servers in DHCPv6 [1].


2. Requirements


   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3. Terminology


   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [1].


4. Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Servers option


   The Simple Network Time Protocol Servers option provides a list of 
   one or more IPv6 addresses of SNTP [3] servers available to the 
   client for synchronization. The clients use these SNTP servers to
   synchronize their system time to that of the standard time servers. 
   Clients MUST treat the list of SNTP servers as an ordered list. The 
   server MAY list the SNTP servers in the order of preference. 
   
   The option defined in this document can only be used to configure
   information about SNTP servers that can be reached using IPv6. The
   DHCP option to configure information about IPv4 SNTP servers can be
   found in RFC 2132 [4]. Mechanisms for configuring IPv4/IPv6 dual-
   stack applications are being considered, but are not specified in
   this document.


   The format of the Simple Network Time Protocol Servers option is as 
   shown below:

   messages:  Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request and Reply. If this option appears in other than the

Internet-Draft            SNTP Configuration Option for DHCPv6   Oct 2004


   messages specified above, the receiver SHOULD ignore the option.
   
   The option number for this option MAY appear in the Option Request
   Option [1] in the following messages:  Solicit, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure. If this option number appear
   in the Option Request Option in other than the messages specified above, 
   the receiver SHOULD ignore the option number.


6. Security Considerations


   The SNTP servers option may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 server to
   cause DHCPv6 clients to contact a rogue SNTP server, resulting in 
   invalid synchronization of time in client and finally leading to
   time critical applications running inaccurately in client machine.
   The time accuracy can be crucial to some security algorithms. For 
   example, it may cause expired certificates to gain a new life, making
   the applications running on the client machine less secure. It can 
   even cause clients to set their time incorrectly, making them 
   vulnerable to replay attacks in protocols that use time stamps to 
   detect replays.


   To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use 
   authenticated DHCPv6 (see "Authentication of DHCP messages" section
   in the DHCPv6 specification [1]).


7. IANA Considerations


   IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options 
   from the option-code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of the
   DHCPv6 specification [1].


   Option Name         Value    Described in
   OPTION_SNTP_SERVERS   tbd     Section 4.
