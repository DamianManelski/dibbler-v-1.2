#
# Example client configuration file: Autodetect
#

# This config file is commented out.
# Dibbler-client will autodetect all up, running, IPv6-supporting, multicast 
# capable interfaces and will try to obtain one IPv6 address on each of them.

# To manually specify, what parameter should be obtained, uncomment 
# appropriate sections below. To get full list of supported options, 
# see Dibbler User's Guide.

#log-mode short

# 7 = omit debug messages
#log-level 7

# Current Dibbler release adds obtained addresses with /64 prefix. Although
# this violates spec (RFC3315), it is very useful as hosts in the network can
# exchange data immediately. To restore previous behavior, uncomment this line:
# strict-rfc-no-routing

#iface "eth0" {
#  ia
#  option dns-server
#  option domain
#}
