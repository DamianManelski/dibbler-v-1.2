# Current Dibbler release adds obtained addresses with /64 prefix. Although
# this violates spec (RFC3315), it is very useful as hosts in the network can
# exchange data immediately. To restore previous behavior, uncomment this line:
# strict-rfc-no-routing

     // will ask for it. If server supports it too, addr-params option will be
     // granted.
