# Dibbler 1.0.0RC1 and earlier added obtained addresses with /64 prefix. This
# violated spec (RFC3315), but was very useful as hosts in the network can
# exchange data immediately, without extra wait for receiving corresponding RA.
# See discussion here: https://klub.com.pl/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=222
# To restore previous behavior, uncomment this line:
# strict-rfc-no-routing 0

# Dibbler can detect interfaces and ask for address on every suitable interface.
# If that is what you require, just don't mention any interfaces

# On the other hand, you may want to specify interfaces to be configured
