 Scripts for TAHI tests
------------------------

Scripts in this directory can be used to run TAHI tests on Dibbler.
They are in a very early stage of development, so they are not very
usable yet.

TODO:
- remove server-AddrMgr.xml after test (otherwise following tests 
  get NoAddrAvail)
- check that server indeed started after start attempt
- check that server indeed stopped after stop attempt
- get additional files (dibbler-server.log, server-cache.xml, etc.)
